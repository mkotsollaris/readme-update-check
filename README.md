# Orb Template

`Stale.MD` is a CircleCI orb that identifies stale documentation (ie 90 days of unchanged `.MD` file) and warns developers on maintaing their documentation.

# Usage

TBD

# Motivation

Inspired by [Software Engineering at Google](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48816586-software-engineering-at-google), where there was a reference that Google runs a similar pattern internally to embrace continuous software engineering developments and constantly update their documentation.

By utilizing this orb command, developers are reminded that while their software updates so does their documentation.

This orb aspires to make developers treat their documentation as production level code where they constantly are motivated to update it.
